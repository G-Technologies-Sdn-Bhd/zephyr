Example Decoded ASCII data from firmware:

gmoc hw_manager: - how to take care selected type communication {cellular n wifi}
          now:      - currently bypass hw_manage which is not good hardfault line 160|250

telemetry: -need to add lora transport 

rb: -did not not know how yc store data probably in json
    -for lora need to modify it because it store in string 

identify: need to update sn to lora DEVEUI config

lora_at driver: -manage to join device to notify other modules
                -take care of error like cant send 
          now:  -due to ebyte reply send start with "OK+RECV:2,00,00" is unsual like gsm and esp  
                
gps driver for lora: -currently gps is depend on gps ec21 
                     -need to create gps that depend on loRa driver 
                     /*No hw was provided yet*/
location compoent: need to update to after gps driver for lora is finish

timesync: -due cant obtain datetime, we need to depend on gps (wait for gps driver first) 

#Software/Sever#
chripstack server: -think of did need to add new device every time power new device 
                   -yes like i said before doenst to add sn on lora string but we need to set up device on chripstack applcation 

nodered:  -decode lora data to string 
          -do one example to deciper data to real data eg - battery voltage("0254" to 0.596 V) 

done :lora data pass: how to get data to put lora struct {eg- gps,siesmic}
done: modify sbiryb module to send using lora 
done: -decode temperature data and hummidity data show on lora at sample
     - decode style using legacy string
     - make macro "roughly" structure for lora
     -give syafiq to creating new module that not using sList like smp
      instead using function call
