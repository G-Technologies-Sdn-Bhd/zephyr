type of communication
-cellular 
-wifi
-lora

todo: /*FW Take more time to debug and test even already send data to lora gateway*/

Example Decoded ASCII data from firmware:
"025400000000000000000000002200000000
780300000000ffff9bc700000000564000000
000000000000000000000000000d1041b5500
0000000000000000110000000000000000000
0000000000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000"

gmoc hw_manage: - macam mana utk take care nk guna selected type communication {cellular n wifi}
          now:      - currently bypass hw_manage which is not good 

lora_at driver: -manage to join device to notify other modules
                -take care of error like cant send 
          now:  -due to ebyte reply send start with "OK+RECV:2,00,00" is unsual like gsm and esp  
                
gps driver for lora: -currently gps is depend on gps ec21 
                     -need to create gps that depend on loRa driver 
                     /*No hw was given yet*/

timesync: -due cant obtain datetime, we need to depend on gps (wait for gps driver first) 

nodered:  -decode lora data to string 
          -do one example to deciper data to real data eg - battery voltage("0254" to 0.596 V) 

done :lora data pass: how to get data to put lora struct {eg- gps,siesmic}
done: modify sbiryb module to send using lora 
done: -decode temperature data and hummidity data show on lora at sample
     - decode style using legacy string
     - make macro "roughly" structure for lora
     -give syafiq to creating new module that not using sList like smp
      instead using function call
